# Using the Python language, have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr 
# and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. 
# If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. 
# An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, 
# where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio. 
# Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 
# 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.
